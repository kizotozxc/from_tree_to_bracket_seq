# Bracket sequence from Tree

## Introduction
This project implements a tree structure from a given Prüfer code, allowing for two main operations:
1. Displaying all edges of the constructed tree.
2. Generating a bracket sequence representation of the tree, starting from a specified root node.

## Features
- Construct tree from Prüfer code.
- Display all edges of the tree.
- Generate bracket sequence representation.
